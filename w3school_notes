We can split the data types into three main categories:

Numerical
Categorical
Ordinal
##############################
In Machine Learning (and in mathematics) there are often three values that interests us:

Mean - The average value
Median - The mid point value
Mode - The most common value
###############################
Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.

A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.

A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range
################################
Standard Deviation is often represented by the symbol Sigma: o

Variance is often represented by the symbol Sigma Square: o^2
